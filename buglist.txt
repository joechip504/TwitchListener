THINGS TO FIX:

    
  -- Added a fix for the chat disconnecting issue. Bot chats anarchy or democracy every 2-4 minutes, which seems to keep it connected to chat.

  -- Definitely not pulling in all of twitch chat. Not sure if this can be fixed, since the guy who wrote TPP
      seems to be having the same issue. Works fine for channels with lower traffic.


THINGS TO ADD:

  -- What constitutes abnormal behavior?
  -- Heroku Worker
  -- Email service, eventually
  -- Fuckshitstackoverflow.com

RESOLVED:

  (02/25/2014 @ 11:30 am)
  -- Program hangs after 5-10 minutes of running. Not sure if it's my internet, or if it's just timing out. 
    -- Regardless, need to check socket() docs and lookup a way to check connectivitiy. If it disconnects, reconnect automatically
